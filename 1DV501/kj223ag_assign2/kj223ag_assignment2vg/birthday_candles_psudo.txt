important constants
AGE = 100
CANDLES PER BOX = 24

initialize usefull variables
candles left
total boxes

make a loop that loops through each birthday from 0 to 100
for i in AGE
    candles needed = i

    do we need to buy more candles?
    Yes? then do this:
        boxes to buy = candles needed - candles left + CANDLES PER BOX / CANDLES PER BOX
        candles left + boxes to buy x CANDLES PER BOX - candles needed

        update the total number of boxes and print a message

    No? then do this:
        use up some of the existing candles
        candles left - candles needed

calculate the remaining candles after the 100th birthday

print the final results
